## Speaker Bio

**Tomasz Szmidt** is a Data Science Manager at WithSecure. He builds his career at the intersection of two dynamic worlds: advanced data analysis and cybersecurity. As a "data scientist who became a manager in cyber", he specializes in using machine learning algorithms to detect and neutralize modern digital threats.

During his presentations (including at Infoshare), he enjoys demystifying the topic of phishing, showing what hooks even the most aware programmers most often fall for. In his work, he combines an analytical approach to data with practical building of organizational resilience to social engineering attacks.

## Talk Abstract

By design, phishing makes you turn off thinking and act mindlessly. Software developers won't fall into Nigerian Prince charming, won't transfer sums of money just because 'the CEO asked them to'. They will be social engineered by techniques that appeal to their career paths, ways of working or IT community values. Hackers exploit what we trust, like or crave for at work. In this presentation we will go through real world notorious campaigns that target developers, learn who are the attackers and what they go after.
