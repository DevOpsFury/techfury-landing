## Speaker Bio

**Piotr Ogrodnicki** is a Senior Backend Engineer, Product Owner, and advisor at Useme. An expert with many years of experience in building and scaling system architectures for the fintech and marketplace sectors. At Useme, he plays a unique role, combining the world of clean code with product vision – as an engineer and Product Owner, he ensures that technology not only works but actually solves business problems.

He specializes in designing scalable backend solutions and optimizing development processes in rapidly growing organizations. When not working on system architecture, he can be found on board the STS Fryderyk Chopin, where as an officer he translates the principles of efficient command from the sea to software engineering. At conferences, he enjoys sharing a practical approach to building products that withstand the test of time and scale.

## Talk Abstract

Scaling is not just about bigger servers — above all, it is a test of architecture, processes, and people. Using Useme as an example, I will talk about the evolution from an agile startup to a mature IT organization that had to grow up in order to survive its own success. You will learn how to manage technical debt and build structure without losing startup energy — straight from the front lines, without marketing gloss.
